While a readme is fine and all, it is missing [one very cool and important feature](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/playground) on GitHub, which is why I have put together a very fine documentation with interactive code examples. Vality is best explained with examples. I even registered a custom domain for this, so it must be serious!
